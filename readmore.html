      <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
        <div class="card card-body">
          A. Clinical trials are in general medical or health related research studies that are conducted in human. These trials follow a defined protocol aimed to evaluate medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention to help find out if a new treatment is safe and effective and/or has less harmful side effects than the standard treatment.

Some clinical trials seek participate with illnesses or conditions while others need healthy participants. These guidelines are not used to reject interested participants personally. Instead, it is used to ensure the safety of the participants by identifying appropriate participants for each clinical trial.

      <h3> <b> On Study </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For most studies, you exit around 8am the following day. Some studies involve earlier check in and longer stays. Please refer to the Current Studies listing on the website for more details. There are also some studies called "multiple-dose" or "steady-state" that involve extended stays in the clinic. Volunteers may stay anywhere from 5 to 30 days.

Most studies involve between 2 and 4 overnight stays in the clinic. Please refer to the Current Studies listing on the website or contact our Recruiting Center (416-759-5554) for a detailed study schedule. In addition to overnight stays, some studies have "return blood draws". In these studies, volunteers are required to return to the clinic at the designated time to have a blood sample drawn. In most cases you should be at the clinic less than 30 minutes. Detailed times and dates for the return blood draws are provided in advance. Compensation for the return blood draws is included in the study fee.

Volunteers are also fully informed with regard to drug, adverse events, and procedures (e.g. blood draws, ECGs, etc.) that will be performed on study. PMRI wants to ensure that you understand what to expect while on study. It is important to note that for most studies volunteers will only be given a single dose of the study drug. This minimal exposure reduces the likelihood of adverse events.

  Q. How much blood will be taken?  </a>

    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample17">
        <div class="card card-body">
              A. Each study is different. Our recruiters will inform you of the total amount of blood that will be taken for your specific study. Generally, the amount of blood taken is relatively small. To help you better understand the amount of blood taken, we will provide you a percentage comparison to a typical blood donation (i.e. to Canadian Blood Services).

While on study, we take a small amount of blood (about 6 mL) at specific sampling times. The frequency (how often) and number of samples drawn is different for every study. Each Subject may choose to have the blood drawn by direct venipuncture (like when you go for a blood test) or have a catheter inserted. The choice is yours. Before deciding whether of not to participate in a study, you will be informed of the amount of sampling scheduled and total amount of blood required.

  </a>

    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample18">
        <div class="card card-body">
              A. To protect your health and wellbeing, a "lock-out" period is enforced after you complete a study. The typical lock-out period is 30 days and is based on both the amount of blood drawn and the type of drug. This means that after completing a study, you must wait 30 days before participating in another study - whether at Pharma Medica Research Inc. or another company. The lock-out period is in place to protect your health and safety, and is calculated based on the amount of blood taken as well as the type of drug.

    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample19">
        <div class="card card-body">
              A. A wash-out period is the amount of time scheduled between doses of the drug. For example, after staying in the clinic overnight and taking a dose of a drug you will typically go home, then return and enter the clinic again for another single dose of the study drug on another day. The period between visits is called the "wash-out period". It is typically 1 week but may be 2 weeks or longer.
