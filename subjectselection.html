Full panel all the time! From healthy volunteer subjects, special populations such as pre or post menopausal women or patients we are here for you. Being located in the Greater Toronto Area, gives us access to a diverse population which is what Regulators look for in clinical trials. We draw from our active database which boasts over X volunteers in addition to reaching out by various advertising medians. We also have a very effective referral program - participants love the safe and comfortable environment offered at PMRI and spread the word. We are also enrolled in clinical RSVP which securely and confidentially validates subjects eligibility prior to enrollment by using biometrics. The goal is prevent dual enrollment which leads to increased accuracy of clinical study data and improves the participantâ€™s safety.
